    <h3>Intervention Programming</h3>
    <p>
        The sexual assault prevention movement started with intervention – brave, trailblazing activists who named the crime, got laws on the books, and built shelters to provide support and services to victims, helping them on their journey toward being survivors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sexual assault is pandemic. The numbers – as many as 17.7 million women and 2.78 million men have been victims of sexual assault (see more information on sexual assault numbers) – are staggering. The foundation of WCASA’s work is providing resources to agencies which provide direct services to the faces behind those numbers.
