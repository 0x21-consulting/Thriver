                <h1>Bill Targets Transgendered Students</h1>
            </div>

                    Madison – October 13, 2015 – As organizations that have worked productively with elected officials from across the spectrum to reduce gender-based violence, End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault are extremely disappointed in politicians’ recent efforts to insert themselves in school bathrooms and override the judgment of educators and local officials. This legislation will needlessly complicate the lives of transgender students, whose experiences inside and outside of school are already often marked by bullying, physical and sexual violence, and the mental health impacts of abuse. We stand firmly opposed to the legislation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The legislation would further stigmatize students who are already highly susceptible to bullying and abuse at school. Seventy-eight percent of transgender youth reported significant abuse at school and over one-third of these youth experience physical violence because of their gender identity. Over threefourths of transgender students report being sexually harassed, such as receiving unwanted sexual remarks or being touched inappropriately. Studies show that transgender individuals who are prevented from using the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity are more likely to be physically and verbally harassed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The abuse, stigma and bullying that youth face at school has life and death consequences. Half of transgender youth will make at least one suicide attempt before they reach the age of 20. Here in Wisconsin, we remember Cameron, Skylar and others who took their own lives in the last year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transgender youth are also at risk to become homeless because of family rejection and discrimination. In turn, homelessness puts these youth at extremely high risk for child sex trafficking. Many legislators are taking positive steps to address these very serious problems. We urge the legislature to abandon the misguided “bathroom legislation” and focus on supporting those who are most marginalized and in need of our support.
