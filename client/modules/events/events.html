                        What is “Wrap Around the Capitol?” For the past 4 years, the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault has organized this event as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month. The event involves a rally outside the capitol, and survivors of sexual violence, allies, advocates, and other community members carrying strips of denim around the capitol until the two ends meet each other. This act symbolizes a statewide (and international, per below) effort to end sexual violence in solidarity with survivors and their allies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why denim? Because of an international outrage. In the 1990s, an 18 year-old woman was raped by a 45 year-old driving instructor in Italy. The perpetrator was arrested, prosecuted, convicted of rape, and sentenced to jail. However, the Supreme Court overturned the rape conviction. The judges believed that the victim must have consented to sexual contact since, in their opinion, her jeans were so tight the perpetrator could not have gotten them off without her assistance. Outraged, the Italian Parliament protested by wearing jeans to work. Thus was born Denim Day, which is observed in the U.S. on April 29.
